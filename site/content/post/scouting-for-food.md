Last week the Berkley Scouts BSA Troop 31 and Pack 16
participated in Narragansett Council's
[Scouting for Food](https://www.narragansettbsa.org/camping-activities/scouting-for-food/)
program.

So far, 309 lbs have been collected and donated to [Open Shelves Food Pantry](https://www.facebook.com/OpenShelvesFoodPantry/) in Berkley, MA.

Thanks for supporting your community.
