Last week the Berkley Scouts BSA Troop 31 and Pack 16
participated in Narragansett Council's
<a href="https://www.narragansettbsa.org/camping-activities/scouting-for-food/" rel="noopener">Scouting for Food</a> program.

So far we have collected over 300 lbs and donated it to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenShelvesFoodPantry/" rel="noopener">Open Shelves Food Pantry</a> in Berkley, MA.

Thanks for supporting your community.
